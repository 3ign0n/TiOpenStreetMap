I compare the following Open Street Map implementation

- OsmAnd http://osmand.net/
- Big Plannet Tracks http://code.google.com/p/big-planet-tracks/
- MapDroid http://tedp.id.au/mapdroid/
- RMaps2 http://code.google.com/p/robertprojects/


I think RMaps2 is one of the most active project, 
simple design and small footprint.
So I choose it as a base project to realize a offline map feature.
