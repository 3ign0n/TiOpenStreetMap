How to be porting it as Titanium module
1. check out source code from git://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand.git
//2. import DataExtractionOSM dir into eclipse project and export as JAR file
//3. create Android project from existing source, select OsmAnd dir, and export as JAR file
2. copy all of *.java files in DataExtractionOSM into titanium modules's src dir, keeping their directory structure
3. copy all of *.java files in OsmAnd into titanium modules's src dir, keeping their directory structure
     *1  overwrite DataExtractionOSM/src/net/osmand/LogUtil.java with OSMAnd/src/net/osmand/LogUtil.java

4. edit the file (THIS IS ONLY FOR JAPANESE ENVRONMENT)
     /Library/ApplicationÂ¥ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.6.1/module/android/build.xml
     in javac section, add encoding="UTF-8" addribute

5. write bridge code between Titanium and OsmAnd
6. build the module
